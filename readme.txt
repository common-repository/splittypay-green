This plugin allows customers to pay their orders devolving the 1% of the order amount for one of the causes supported by Splittypay.

== Description ==

Green pay allows customers to pay their orders devolving the 1% of the order amount for one of the causes supported by Splittypay. 
Customers will be redirected to the Splittypay platform to complete the payment: from the platform customers can: 
*   Pay the order by credit card
*   Select the project to support   
*   Monitor the payment in real time

Merchants need to register to the Splittypay service to access the Green functionality as the plugin requires an API key to work properly.
A merchant, to get an API key, needs to fulfill four simple steps:
*   Connect (or create from scratch) their Stripe account
*   Fill some basic information about the business
*   Upload a logo
*   Customize the cart duration on the Splittypay platform

The Green pay plugin can work both in sandbox and live mode. Merchants can switch between the environments from the settings panel
(different API keys are required for the sandbox and live environments).
